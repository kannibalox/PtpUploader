PtpUploader by TnS

With the PtpUploader's WebUI you can upload to PTP by specifying a torrent file and an IMDb or PTP link.
There is also an automatic mode built-in that can check announcements from IRC or RSS and upload everything automatically.

Supported sites for automatic mode:
	- Cinemageddon (RSS)
	- Cinematik (RSS)
	- GFT (IRC, RSS)
	- Karagarga (RSS)
	- SceneAccess (IRC, RSS)
		- Use it at your own risk! From their rules: "You may not upload the content of our torrents or the .torrent file itself to any other places outside SCC."
	- The Dark Syndicate (IRC, RSS)
	- TorrentLeech (IRC, RSS)
	- FunFile (IRC)

PtpUploader can create release description (with media info and screenshots) for manual uploading from command line.
	Syntax:
		- "ReleaseInfoMaker.py <target directory or filename>" creates the release description and starts seeding the torrent.
		- "ReleaseInfoMaker.py --notorrent <target directory or filename>" creates the release description.
		
	Use the resulting torrent that starts with PTP for uploading to the tracker.
	
There is a helper script available at http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/133847 to send torrents from a wide variety of sites directly to PtpUploader.
