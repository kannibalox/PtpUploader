PtpUploader v0.1 by TnS

The program does three things: watches for release announcements, downloads them and uploads them to PTP.

This is my first Python program ever, so sorry for the C-ish code and for the semicolons. :)

Supported sources:
	- Cinemageddon
	- GFT

How it works:
	1. Announcement watching
		- it uses a wrapper for pyWHATauto to watch release announcements on IRC
		- it uses FlexGet to watch release announcements on RSS
		- checks release name and filters out the unwanted releases
			- manual announcements are not checked
		- gets IMDb id from NFO
			- NFO is read from the source site
			- in case of manual downloads, NFO is read from the downloaded release
		- release type is figured out from release name (DVD rip, X264, ...)
		- checks if the release exists on PTP
			- manual announcements are not checked
			- uses IMDb id and release type to check against the existing releases on PTP
	2. Downloading
		- in case of manual downloads it does nothing
		- downloads the torrent file from the source
		- torrent file is added to rTorrent and the bot waits till it finishes
	3. Uploading
		- the releases is extracted (including the subtitles) to a separate directory
		- makes media info for all videos
		- takes screenshots from the first (sorted by name) video and uploads to an image hoster (ptpimg or imgur)
		- makes the torrent
		- checks (again) if the release exists on PTP
		- if there is no movie page for this movie on PTP, it uses PTP's IMDb info getter to fill out the required details
			- rehosts the poster if it presents
		- adds the torrent to rTorrent without hash checking
		- fills out PTP's upload or add format form
		- refreshes the movie page (needed to refresh the IMDb info)
		
Manual uploading:
	PtpUploader can create release desription (with media info and screenshots) for manual uploading.

	Syntax:
		- "ReleaseInfoMaker.py <target directory or filename>" creates the release description and starts seeding the torrent.
		- "ReleaseInfoMaker.py --notorrent <target directory or filename>" creates the release description.
		
	Use the resulting torrent that starts with PTP for uploading to the tracker. The other one, that starts with "fast resume", is for rTorrent, don't upload that!
