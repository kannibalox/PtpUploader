PtpUploader by TnS

With the PtpUploader's WebUI you can upload to PTP by specifying a torrent file and an IMDb or PTP link.
There is also an automatic mode built-in that can check announcements from IRC or RSS and upload everything automatically.

Supported sites for automatic mode:
	- Cinemageddon (RSS)
	- Cinematik (RSS)
	- GFT (IRC, RSS)
	- Karagarga (RSS)
	- SceneAccess (IRC, RSS)
		- Use it at your own risk! From their rules: "You may not upload the content of our torrents or the .torrent file itself to any other places outside SCC."
	- TorrentLeech (IRC, RSS)

PtpUploader can create release desription (with media info and screenshots) for manual uploading from command line.
	Syntax:
		- "ReleaseInfoMaker.py <target directory or filename>" creates the release description and starts seeding the torrent.
		- "ReleaseInfoMaker.py --notorrent <target directory or filename>" creates the release description.
		
	Use the resulting torrent that starts with PTP for uploading to the tracker. The other one, that starts with "fast resume", is for rTorrent, don't upload that!
